# Algorithm Repository by Alphabet

Welcome to the **Algorithm Repository**! This project organizes algorithms and data structures into separate files and folders based on the first letter of their name. Each folder represents a letter from **A to Z**, and algorithms or concepts whose names begin with that letter will be placed inside the corresponding folder.

---

## üìö Structure Overview

The repository is organized as follows:

- **A**: Algorithms that begin with "A" (e.g., `Array sorting algorithms`, `A* pathfinding algorithm`).
- **B**: Algorithms that begin with "B" (e.g., `Binary Search`, `Breadth-First Search`).
- **C**: Algorithms that begin with "C" (e.g., `Counting Sort`, `Cycle Detection`).
- **...**: Continues for each letter of the alphabet.

Each file inside these folders will contain a single algorithm or concept, accompanied by documentation, examples, and explanations to make learning and using these algorithms easy.
